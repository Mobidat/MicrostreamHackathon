Corona Diary helps tracking health events related to patients and medical advisors

Corona Diary is a demo application for logging health events related to Corona Crisis.
This application was created with the IDE Rapidclipse X using VAADIN 14 and Microstream 4.
Random data can be generated on the start screen.
Many thanks to the team from https://hackathon.microstream.one/ for their kind support.
